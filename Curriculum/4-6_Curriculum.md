# Grades 4-6 C-STEM Curriculum

## Overview
The Grades 4-6 C-STEM curriculum deepens students' understanding of STEM concepts through more complex projects and problem-solving challenges. This curriculum emphasizes critical thinking, creativity, and leadership, while reinforcing Catholic values and teachings. Through technology, engineering, and environmental stewardship, students will explore how STEM can be used to serve others and protect God’s creation.

## Weekly Lessons

### Week 1: Exploring God's Patterns and Design
- **Tool to Check Out**: Dash Robots
- **Lesson Name**: [Navigating God's Creation](./LessonPlans/Grades4-6/Grades4-6_Navigating_God s_Creation.md)
- **Topic**: Introduction to patterns and navigation in God’s world.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will guide Dash Robots through a complex path that represents an act of service, such as delivering resources to people in need. They will be introduced to more advanced coding concepts, focusing on problem-solving and efficient navigation.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Reflect on the Catholic teaching of helping those in need, as the robots mimic acts of service. Discuss how we are called to use our talents and resources to serve others.

### Week 2: Building Strong Foundations
- **Tool to Check Out**: EiE: Designing Bridges Kit
- **Lesson Name**: [Engineering Bridges for Communities](.LessonPlans/Grades4-6/Grades4-6_Engineering_Bridges_for_Communities.md)
- **Topic**: Engineering strong and durable structures.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will explore different types of bridge designs (suspension, beam, arch) and test which structures hold the most weight. They will analyze their designs to understand the importance of balance, strength, and material properties in engineering.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Discuss how bridges symbolize connection and support, much like how we are called to support and serve our communities, just as bridges support people in crossing difficult terrain.

### Week 3: Protecting God’s Creation
- **Tool to Check Out**: EiE: Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit
- **Lesson Name**: [Protecting God’s Creation with Engineering](./LessonPlans/Grades4-6/Grades4-6_Protecting_Gods_Creation.md)
- **Topic**: Engineering solutions to environmental challenges.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will design and implement methods for cleaning up a simulated oil spill. They will evaluate the effectiveness of their designs and reflect on the environmental and ethical challenges of pollution and waste management.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Reflect on the Catholic call to care for God’s creation and protect the environment for future generations. Discuss how we are responsible for being good stewards of the Earth, as instructed in the Bible.

### Week 4: Innovating for Good
- **Tool to Check Out**: Little Bits
- **Lesson Name**: [Innovating for Good](/LessonPlans/Grades4-6/Grades4-6_Innovating_for_Good.md)
- **Topic**: Exploring circuits and technology to create solutions.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will design and build a device using Little Bits to address a specific problem, such as an alarm system or sensor-based device. They will work in teams to brainstorm, design, and test their inventions, applying basic circuitry and engineering principles.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Discuss the ethics of innovation and how technology should always serve humanity. Reflect on Catholic social teachings regarding the use of technology to respect human dignity and serve the common good.

## Catholic Integration Themes
- **Week 1**: Helping those in need through service, using our talents and technology for the greater good.
- **Week 2**: Building bridges as a metaphor for community support and connecting with others in meaningful ways.
- **Week 3**: Stewardship and environmental responsibility, caring for God’s creation.
- **Week 4**: Ethical innovation, ensuring that technology is used to benefit humanity and respect God’s design.

## Assessment
- Participation in group activities and class discussions.
- Application of problem-solving and engineering principles to complete design challenges.
- Demonstrated understanding of how Catholic values are integrated into STEM activities.
- Creativity and collaboration in developing solutions to real-world problems.

## Materials Needed
- **Week 1**: Dash Robots, Chromebooks (optional for more complex programming)
- **Week 2**: EiE Designing Bridges Kit, Chromebooks (for research on bridge design)
- **Week 3**: EiE Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit, Chromebooks
- **Week 4**: Little Bits, Chromebooks

## Conclusion
The Grades 4-6 C-STEM curriculum is designed to challenge students to think critically about how STEM concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems while maintaining a strong foundation in Catholic values. Through these hands-on activities, students will learn how to use their talents to serve others and honor God’s creation.
