## Curriculum Structure

The C-STEM Curriculum is divided into three sections based on grade groups. Each curriculum overview provides a detailed outline of the topics covered in STEM, along with how **Catholic values** such as stewardship, ethical responsibility, and service to others are woven into each lesson.

### Kindergarten Curriculum

The Kindergarten curriculum introduces young students to basic concepts in technology and engineering, focusing on hands-on activities that help them explore God’s creation. It emphasizes **stewardship**, **creativity**, and **kindness**, fostering early problem-solving skills.

### 1st to 3rd Grade Curriculum

- [1st to 3rd Grade Curriculum](./Grades1-3_Curriculum.md)

The curriculum for Grades 1-3 builds on the foundational skills introduced in Kindergarten. It explores more complex concepts in technology and engineering, while continuing to emphasize **faith-based values** such as teamwork, ethical responsibility, and care for creation. Lessons are designed to engage students in hands-on activities, promoting **inquiry** and **collaboration**.

### 4th to 6th Grade Curriculum

For Grades 4-6, the curriculum introduces advanced concepts in STEM, focusing on **design thinking**, **innovation**, and **problem-solving**. Students are encouraged to reflect on the ethical implications of technology and how they can use their skills to serve others and care for God's creation. This curriculum prepares students for more challenging engineering and technology projects while maintaining a strong focus on **Catholic teachings**.
