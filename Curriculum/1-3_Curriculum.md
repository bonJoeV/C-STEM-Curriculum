# Grades 1-3 C-STEM Curriculum

## Overview
The Grades 1-3 C-STEM curriculum builds on foundational STEM concepts while integrating Catholic values into hands-on learning activities. Students will explore God's creation through interactive technology, engineering challenges, and environmental stewardship projects. Each lesson ties STEM learning with faith, emphasizing responsibility, creativity, and the interconnectedness of creation.

## Weekly Lessons

### Week 1: Exploring God's Patterns and Design
- **Tool to Check Out**: Bee Bots
- **Lesson Name**: [Navigating God's Creation](../LessonPlans/Grades1-3/Navigating_God's_Creation.md)
- **Topic**: Introduction to patterns and navigation in God’s world.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will use Bee Bots to follow a path resembling a story from the Bible, such as the journey of the Israelites. Basic coding concepts will be introduced, showing how programming allows us to follow steps, just as God guides us through life.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Discuss how God guides us through our lives, just as we guide the Bee Bots through their paths.

### Week 2: Building Strong Foundations
- **Tool to Check Out**: EiE: Designing Bridges Kit
- **Lesson Name**: [Building Bridges Like Engineers](../LessonPlans/Grades1-3/Building_Bridges_Like_Engineers.md)
- **Topic**: Engineering strong and durable structures.

  **Activity**:  
  In teams, students will design and build bridges using the EiE Designing Bridges Kit. They will test different materials to explore the concept of strength and durability, solving problems as they adjust their designs.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Discuss how building bridges helps connect people, just as Jesus connects us to God.

### Week 3: Protecting God’s Creation
- **Tool to Check Out**: EiE: Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit
- **Lesson Name**: [Caring for Creation with Technology](../LessonPlans/Grades1-3/Caring_for_Creation_with_Technology.md)
- **Topic**: Engineering solutions to environmental challenges.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will simulate cleaning an oil spill using the EiE kit. They will explore various methods for absorbing and containing the spill, discussing the environmental impacts of pollution.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Reflect on the Catholic teaching of stewardship, emphasizing our responsibility to care for God’s creation.

### Week 4: Innovating for Good
- **Tool to Check Out**: Little Bits
- **Lesson Name**: [Creating with Purpose](../LessonPlans/Grades1-3/Creating_with_Purpose.md)
- **Topic**: Exploring circuits and technology to create solutions.

  **Activity**:  
  Students will design a small device using Little Bits that has a functional purpose, such as turning on a light when it’s dark. This introduces basic circuitry and problem-solving with technology.
  
  **Catholic Integration**:  
  Discuss how technology can be used for good, and how innovation reflects God's creative spirit in us.

## Catholic Integration Themes
- **Week 1**: God’s guidance in our lives, reflected through coding and navigation.
- **Week 2**: Building strong connections, both structurally and in our relationships with God and others.
- **Week 3**: Stewardship of creation, taking responsibility for protecting the environment.
- **Week 4**: Using our creative gifts and technology to serve others and honor God’s design.

## Assessment
- Participation in group activities and class discussions.
- Ability to follow steps and complete coding or building tasks.
- Understanding of the Catholic values and their integration into STEM concepts.
- Problem-solving and teamwork displayed during engineering and design challenges.

## Materials Needed
- **Week 1**: Bee Bots, iPads (optional for additional guidance)
- **Week 2**: EiE Designing Bridges Kit, iPads
- **Week 3**: EiE Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit, iPads
- **Week 4**: Little Bits, iPads

## Conclusion
The Grades 1-3 C-STEM curriculum encourages students to explore STEM concepts through a faith-based lens, connecting their learning to Catholic teachings. Each week’s lesson helps develop their creativity, problem-solving skills, and understanding of God’s creation.
