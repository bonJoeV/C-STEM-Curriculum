# Grades 4-6 Coding Curriculum

## Topic
Intermediate Block Coding and Problem-Solving with Scratch

## Tools
Chromebooks or iPads (using Scratch web app)

## Activity
Students use Scratch to create an interactive story or simple game where characters encounter problems related to the environment, like pollution or conserving resources. They program solutions into the story, such as cleaning up litter or planting trees, using conditionals and loops. For example, they might design a game where players must 'pick up' digital trash to clean a virtual park.
