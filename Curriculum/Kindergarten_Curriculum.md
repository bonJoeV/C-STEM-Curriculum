- **Community**: Promoting teamwork and helping each other during STEM activities.

## Topics and Activities

### Lesson: God's Creation Through Movement and Technology

- **Topic:** Introduction to Basic Robotics and Problem Solving
- **Tools:** EV3 units, Bee Bot 10 pack, Duplos
- **Activity:**
  - Introduce students to robots and how they can help us understand and explore God’s creation.
  - Use Bee Bots to navigate simple mazes, encouraging problem-solving and collaboration.
  - Build simple structures with Duplos to represent animals or nature, reflecting on God’s perfect design.
- **Catholic Integration:**
  - Discuss how God has given humans intelligence to create tools like robots to care for His creation (Genesis 2:15).
  - Emphasize teamwork, helping one another, and reflecting on the importance of community in our faith.

### Lesson: Exploring Patterns in Nature

- **Topic:** Recognizing Patterns in God's Creation
