It seems you've encountered a page that doesn't exist. Don't worry, though! Here are a few ways you can get back on track:

- [Go back to the homepage](/README.md)
- Use the navigation bar above to find what you're looking for.
- If you believe this is an error, please [reach out to us](#) so we can fix it.

Remember, just like in our STEM lessons, sometimes we miss the mark, but every mistake is a step towards growth and discovery.

God bless, and happy learning!

<script type="text/javascript">
// Get the missing URL
var missingUrl = window.location.href;

// Encode the URL components
var issueTitle = encodeURIComponent("Broken link: " + missingUrl);
var issueBody = encodeURIComponent("I tried to access " + missingUrl + " but received a 404 error.");

// Construct the GitHub issue URL
var issueUrl = "https://github.com/bonJoeV/C-STEM-Curriculum/issues/new?title=" + issueTitle + "&body=" + issueBody;

// Set the href attribute of the report link
var reportLink = document.querySelector('a[href="#"]');
if (reportLink) {
    reportLink.setAttribute('href', issueUrl);
}
</script>
