# C-STEM (Catholic STEM) Program

Welcome to the repository for the C-STEM (Catholic STEM) program at Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School. This repository contains the curriculum, lesson plans, and resources for Kindergarten through 6th grade. Our C-STEM curriculum, inspired by the Catholic Schools Center of Excellence (CSCOE), integrates Catholic values with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.

## Program Overview

The C-STEM program engages students in hands-on learning while fostering their faith and understanding of God's creation. By blending STEM concepts with Catholic teachings, students develop problem-solving skills, design-thinking abilities, and ethical responsibility. Our program emphasizes creativity and innovation while grounding students in Catholic values.

## Goals

- **Integrate Faith and STEM**: Teach students how STEM disciplines reflect the beauty and complexity of God’s creation.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Provide practical, project-based experiences to help students understand and apply STEM concepts.
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Encourage ethical use of technology and critical thinking about innovation’s impact on the world.
- **Creativity and Problem-Solving**: Foster creativity and collaboration by engaging students in problem-solving challenges that encourage exploration and innovation.

## Curriculum Structure

The C-STEM curriculum is organized into three grade groups, each with lesson plans tailored to the developmental stages of the students:

- [Kindergarten Curriculum](./Curriculum/Kindergarten_Curriculum.md)
- [1st to 3rd Grade Curriculum](./Curriculum/1-3_Curriculum.md)
- [4th to 6th Grade Curriculum](./Curriculum/4-6_Curriculum.md)

Each curriculum overview provides an outline of the topics covered and the Catholic values integrated into the lessons.

## Lesson Plans

Our lesson plans are organized by grade group and provide detailed guidance for each class session, including objectives, materials, activities, and assessments. Each folder contains lesson plans for four weeks, integrating Catholic values into every aspect of the learning process:
