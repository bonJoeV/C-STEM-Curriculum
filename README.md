# C-STEM (Catholic STEM) Program

Welcome to the repository for the C-STEM (Catholic STEM) program at Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School. This repository contains the curriculum, lesson plans, and resources for Kindergarten through 6th grade. Our C-STEM curriculum, inspired by the Catholic Schools Center of Excellence, integrates Catholic values with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.

## Program Overview

The C-STEM program engages students in hands-on learning while fostering their faith and understanding of God's creation. By blending STEM concepts with Catholic teachings, students develop problem-solving skills, design-thinking abilities, and ethical responsibility. Our program emphasizes creativity and innovation while grounding students in Catholic values.

## Goals

- **Integrate Faith and STEM**: Teach students how STEM disciplines reflect the beauty and complexity of God’s creation.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Provide practical, project-based experiences to help students understand and apply STEM concepts.
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Encourage ethical use of technology and critical thinking about innovation’s impact on the world.
- **Creativity and Problem-Solving**: Foster creativity and collaboration by engaging students in problem-solving challenges that encourage exploration and innovation.

## Curriculum Structure

The C-STEM curriculum is organized into three grade groups, each with lesson plans tailored to the developmental stages of the students:

- [Kindergarten Curriculum](./Curriculum/Kindergarten_Curriculum.md)
- [1st to 3rd Grade Curriculum](./Curriculum/1-3_Curriculum.md)
