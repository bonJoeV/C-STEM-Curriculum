# Parent Resources: Week 1 - What is Engineering? (Tower Power)

### **Overview**
This week, students are introduced to engineering concepts through a hands-on activity where they build towers using simple materials.

### **Discussion Points**
- Ask your child about the tower they built and how it could help others.
- Discuss why engineers build structures and how they serve communities.

### **How You Can Support At Home**
- Take a walk around your neighborhood and observe different structures like bridges or buildings. Discuss their purpose.
- Encourage your child to think of ways to improve their tower design based on their experience in class.
