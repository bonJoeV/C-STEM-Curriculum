## Kindergarten Coding Curriculum
[Class Kindergarten Exploring God's Creation with ScratchJr](Class_Kindergarten_Exploring_Gods_Creation_ScratchJr.md)

### Topic
Introduction to Sequencing and Basic Coding Concepts

### Tools
iPads (using the Code-a-Pillar app or similar sequencing app)

### Activity
Students use the Code-a-Pillar app to arrange and connect segments that make the digital caterpillar move through different paths. Encourage students to create paths that lead to specific images of God’s creations (e.g., flowers, animals, water). Discuss how each command leads the caterpillar closer to a part of creation.

### Catholic Integration
**Following God’s Path** - Discuss how each movement is like following a path, similar to how we follow God’s guidance in caring for creation.

## Grades 1-3 Coding Curriculum
[Class Grades 1-3 Exploring God's Creation with ScratchJr](Class_Grades_1-3_Exploring_Gods_Creation_ScratchJr.md)

### Topic
Basics of Block Coding and Story Creation

### Tools
iPads or Chromebooks (using ScratchJr on iPads or Chromebook-compatible apps)

### Activity
Introduce students to ScratchJr, where they can use blocks to create simple animations. Prompt students to design a story where a character explores nature or helps another character take care of a garden or animal, reflecting the importance of stewardship. Students can program the character to move, jump, or interact with parts of their story using basic block commands.

### Catholic Integration
**Stewardship and Care** - Encourage students to reflect on how they are caring for creation in their stories, similar to how they can show kindness and responsibility in their own lives.

## Grades 4-6 Coding Curriculum
[Class Grades 4-6 Serving the Common Good with Scratch](Class_Grades_4-6_Serving_Common_Good_Scratch.md)

### Topic
Intermediate Block Coding and Problem-Solving

### Tools
Chromebooks or iPads (using Scratch web app)

### Activity
Students use Scratch to create an interactive story or simple game where characters encounter problems related to the environment, like pollution or conserving resources. They program solutions into the story, such as cleaning up litter or planting trees, using conditionals and loops. For example, they might design a game where players must “pick up” digital trash to clean a virtual park.

### Catholic Integration
**Serving the Common Good** - Discuss the value of service, linking their coding activities to real-life actions they can take to care for the earth and their community.
