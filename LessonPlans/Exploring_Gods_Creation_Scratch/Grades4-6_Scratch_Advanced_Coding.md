## Parent Resource
**Dear Parents,**

Our Grades 4-6 students are diving into advanced coding with Scratch, where they’ll create simple games or simulations. This encourages problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity.

**How You Can Support at Home:**
- Ask your child to explain the game or simulation they created.
- Discuss how coding can be used to create solutions that benefit others.

Our hope is for students to see coding as a way to make positive contributions to the world.

Blessings,  
Our Lady of the Prairie Catholic School
