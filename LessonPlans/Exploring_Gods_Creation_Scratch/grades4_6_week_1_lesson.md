# Exploring God's Creation - Week 1

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 45 minutes  
### **Topic**: Storytelling and Game Design with Scratch

---

## **Overview**
Students dive into advanced coding concepts by creating interactive stories and simple games using **Scratch**.

### **Objective**
- Explore the Scratch programming environment.
- Understand variables, loops, and conditional statements.
- Develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills through coding projects.

---

## **Materials**
- Computers with internet access.
- Scratch accounts (students may need to create free accounts).

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**
Begin with a prayer for inspiration and wisdom in today's lesson.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Dear God, thank You for the gift of knowledge and creativity. Guide us as we learn new skills and help us use them to make a positive difference in the world. Amen."

### **2. Introduction (10 minutes)**
- **Discussion**: Introduce the Scratch interface and its capabilities.
- **Demonstration**: Show a sample project highlighting key features.
- **Connection to Faith**: Discuss how we can use technology to serve others and share positive messages.

### **3. Main Activity (25 minutes)**
- **Activity**: Students begin creating an interactive story or simple game in Scratch, incorporating sprites, backdrops, and scripts.
    - Introduce key concepts:
        - **Sprites and Backdrops**: Characters and scenes.
        - **Scripts**: Coding blocks that control sprite behavior.
        - **Events**: Starting actions based on triggers.
        - **Control Structures**: Loops and conditionals.
