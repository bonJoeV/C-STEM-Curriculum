## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer to ask God for wisdom and guidance in our learning and relationships.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, help us build strong relationships with others, just as we learn to build strong bridges today. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Bridges (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show pictures of different bridges. Ask students what bridges are used for and why they are important.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain that just like bridges connect places, God connects us to Him and to each other.

### **3. Building Bridges with Legos (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Guide students in building simple bridges with Lego blocks. Emphasize the importance of balance and strength.

### **4. Testing the Bridges (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: After building, test the bridges by placing small weights or toys on them. Discuss which designs held the most weight and why.
- **Catholic Integration**: Relate this to building strong relationships with others and how our actions can help or hurt those connections.

### **5. Drawing Reflection (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to draw a picture of a bridge they built and to think about how they can be a "bridge" in helping others. 
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their drawings and reflect on how they can help others by building connections.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Building Strong Relationships**: Discuss how, just as bridges connect places, we are called to build strong relationships with others by helping, caring, and being kind.
- **Connection to Jesus**: Relate building strong bridges to following Jesus' teachings, as He is the ultimate "bridge" between us and God.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Bridge Building**: Assess how well students built their bridges using the materials.
- **Reflection Drawings**: Evaluate students' understanding of the connection between bridges and building strong relationships.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson by thanking God for the connections we have with others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
