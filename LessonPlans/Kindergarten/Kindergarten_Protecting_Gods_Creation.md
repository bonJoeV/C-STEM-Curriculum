# Kindergarten: Protecting God’s Creation

### **Grade**: Kindergarten  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Engineering solutions to environmental challenges

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will learn about how engineers help protect the environment. They will simulate cleaning up a spill and learn about their role in caring for God’s creation.

### **Objective**
- To introduce environmental engineering by simulating an oil spill cleanup.
- To understand the importance of caring for creation as part of God’s plan for us.
- To develop problem-solving skills through hands-on activities.

---

## **Materials**
- [EiE: Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- Classroom materials for cleanup simulation (water, paper towels, sponges, oil)
- Drawing paper and crayons

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for guidance in caring for God's creation.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for the beautiful world You created. Help us to take care of it and protect it. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Oil Spills (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show pictures of oil spills in nature and talk about how they hurt animals and plants.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain that God gave us the earth to care for, and when we don’t take care of it, it can hurt His creation.

### **3. Oil Spill Cleanup Simulation (20 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Use the [EiE: Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) to simulate cleaning up a small oil spill. Let students take turns using materials to absorb the oil.
- **Catholic Integration**: Relate the cleanup to the idea of stewardship, emphasizing that God asks us to take care of the earth and everything in it.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Have students draw a picture of something beautiful in nature that they want to protect (e.g., an animal, a tree, a flower).
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their drawings and talk about why they want to protect that part of God's creation.

---

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Emphasize that God calls us to be good stewards of the earth. Caring for creation is part of our responsibility as Catholics.
- **Protecting Creation**: Discuss how protecting the environment is a way to show love for God and others.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in Oil Spill Cleanup**: Observe how well students participate and problem-solve during the simulation.
- **Reflection Drawings**: Assess students' understanding of the importance of protecting God's creation.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer of thanks for God’s creation and ask for help in protecting it.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank you, God, for the world You have given us. Help us to be good stewards and protect all the wonderful things You have made. Amen."
