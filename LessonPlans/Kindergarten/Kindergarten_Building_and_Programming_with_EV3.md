# Kindergarten: Building and Programming with EV3

### **Grade**: Kindergarten  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Introduction to Basic Robotics and Problem Solving

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, Kindergarten students will be introduced to basic robotics using Lego Mindstorms EV3. They will learn how robots can follow simple commands and explore how we can use technology to help care for God’s creation.

### **Objective**
- To introduce the basic concepts of robotics and technology.
- To develop problem-solving skills through programming simple robot movements.
- To reflect on how God gives us the intelligence to create tools to take care of His creation.

## **Materials**
- EV3 units
- Duplos (for building structures)

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer, asking God to help us use the gifts He has given us to learn and create tools that care for the world.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Dear God, thank You for giving us minds that can learn and create. Help us to use our skills to take care of Your creation and help others. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Robotics (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Introduce the concept of robots and how they help us solve problems in the world. Show students the EV3 robot and explain its parts (motors, sensors, etc.).
- **Connection to Faith**: Discuss how God gives us intelligence to create tools, and how we can use these tools to care for others and the Earth.

### **3. Build and Program the EV3 (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will work with EV3 units to build a simple structure using Duplos and learn how to program the robot to move in a straight line. Assist students in using basic commands for the robot.
- **Catholic Integration**: Relate the robot’s ability to follow commands to how we follow God's guidance in our lives, using our gifts to serve others.

### **4. Reflection and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to reflect on how they worked together to build and program the robot. Have them share one thing they learned and how they can use their talents to care for God’s creation.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Discuss how robots can be used to solve problems in the world, just as we are called to use our talents and resources to help others and care for the environment.
- **Teamwork and Community**: Emphasize how working together to build the robot reflects the importance of helping and supporting one another, just as God calls us to live in community.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation**: Observe how well students engage in the building and programming activities.
- **Teamwork**: Assess students' ability to work together to complete the task.
- **Understanding**: Evaluate students’ understanding of basic robotics concepts and the connection between the lesson and Catholic values.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer of thanks for the opportunity to learn and use our gifts for good.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Thank You, God, for helping us learn new things and for giving us talents that we can use to care for Your creation. Help us to always work together and use our gifts to serve others. Amen."
