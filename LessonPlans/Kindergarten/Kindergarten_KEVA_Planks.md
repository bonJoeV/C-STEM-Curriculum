# Kindergarten: Introduction to Building with KEVA Planks

### **Grade**: Kindergarten  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Building and Problem-solving with Simple Ball Runs

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will explore building with KEVA Planks and create simple ball run courses. They will learn about how objects move through gravity and how to design structures that work. This lesson will also introduce the concept of stewardship, reflecting on how we care for the materials and world that God has provided.

### **Objective**
- To introduce students to building and problem-solving through hands-on play.
- To learn how gravity affects motion and apply it to their ball run designs.
- To reflect on the concept of stewardship and caring for God’s creation.

## **Materials**
- KEVA Planks (from [CSCOE STEM Inventory](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/))
- iPads (to document builds with photos)

---

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer to reflect on how we can use what God has given us to create and build.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for the materials and tools we use today. Help us to be creative builders and thoughtful caretakers of the world around us. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Building with KEVA Planks (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Introduce KEVA Planks and show a simple ball run. Talk about gravity and how it makes the ball move down the track.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain that, just as we care for the materials in this project, we are called to care for God’s creation.

### **3. Building and Testing (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: In pairs, students will build simple ball run courses using KEVA Planks. Encourage them to experiment with how to make the ball roll faster or slower.
- **Catholic Integration**: As students build, discuss how being careful with the materials shows respect for the world and what God has given us.

### **4. Documenting and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Using iPads, students will take pictures of their ball runs to share with the class.
- **Sharing**: Have students show their designs and talk about how their structures worked.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Talk about how God has given us the ability to build and create, and it is our responsibility to use materials wisely and with care.
- **Creativity**: Highlight how creating new things helps us reflect God’s creativity in the world.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation and Collaboration**: Observe how well students work together to build their ball runs.
- **Creativity and Problem-Solving**: Evaluate how students solve the challenges of building a functional ball run.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson by thanking God for the opportunity to learn and create.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for the fun we had building and learning today. Help us to always be good caretakers of what You have given us. Amen."
