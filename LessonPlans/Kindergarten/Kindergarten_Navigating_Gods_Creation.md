# Kindergarten: Navigating God's Creation

### **Grade**: Kindergarten  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Exploring patterns and navigation in God’s world

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will be introduced to basic coding and navigation concepts using Bee Bots. They will explore how God's design and patterns are reflected in nature, and how technology like Bee Bots can help us understand and navigate this design.

### **Objective**
- To introduce basic coding and directional concepts using Bee Bots.
- To recognize patterns in nature and connect them to God’s purposeful design.
- To foster an understanding of stewardship by discussing how we care for creation.

## **Materials**
- [Bee Bots](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- iPads (optional for extra activities)
- Large maze mat with nature elements (trees, flowers, animals)
- Markers and drawing paper

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin the lesson with a prayer, asking God for guidance and wisdom in learning about His creation.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for the world You created. Help us to learn how to take care of it and to understand the patterns You have placed in nature. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Patterns in Nature (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show students pictures of trees, flowers, and animals. Ask them to identify any patterns they notice (e.g., tree branches, flower petals, etc.).  
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain that just like God designed the flowers and trees in a specific way, He also gives us ways to follow His path. Bee Bots can help us understand patterns and follow paths just like God leads us.

### **3. Introduction to Bee Bots (10 minutes)**  
- **Show & Tell**: Introduce the Bee Bots and explain how they work. Demonstrate how to press the buttons to move the Bee Bot in different directions (forward, backward, left, right).
- **Hands-On Exploration**: Let students take turns pressing the buttons and watching the Bee Bot move.

### **4. Guided Activity: Navigating a Garden Maze (15 minutes)**  
- **Setup**: Place the large maze mat with nature elements (trees, flowers, animals) on the floor.
- **Activity**: Guide students to use the Bee Bots to navigate the maze, helping the Bee Bot visit different parts of the "garden." Encourage students to think about which buttons they need to press to move from one point to another.
  
  **Example Instructions**:
  - “Can you help the Bee Bot visit the tree?”
  - “Let’s see if the Bee Bot can reach the flowers!”

- **Catholic Integration**: As the students guide the Bee Bot, talk about how God guides us through life, and just as we help the Bee Bot follow the right path, God helps us make good choices.

### **5. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: After the Bee Bot activity, gather the students and ask them to reflect on how they helped the Bee Bot find its way. Relate this to how we can help others find their way through kindness and care.
- **Activity**: Provide markers and paper. Ask the students to draw a picture of their favorite part of God’s creation (a tree, flower, animal, etc.).
- **Sharing**: If time allows, let students share their drawings and explain why they chose that part of creation.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Discuss how we are called to care for God’s creation, just as the students helped the Bee Bot navigate the garden. Emphasize the importance of following God’s path and being good stewards of His world.
- **Respect for God’s Design**: Connect the idea of programming the Bee Bots to following God’s design in nature, highlighting the importance of order, care, and respect.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in the Bee Bot activity**: Observe how well students understand the basic concepts of direction and coding.
- **Reflection drawings**: Assess students' ability to connect their Bee Bot activity to the larger theme of God’s creation and stewardship.

## **Homework/Extension (Optional)**
- At home, students can go on a nature walk with their parents and look for more patterns in God’s creation. Encourage them to draw or describe what they see and bring it back to class next week.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer of thanksgiving for the beauty of God’s creation.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for the beautiful world You have made. Help us to take care of it and follow Your path in everything we do. Amen."
