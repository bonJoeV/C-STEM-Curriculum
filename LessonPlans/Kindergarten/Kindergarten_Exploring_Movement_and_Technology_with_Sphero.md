## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer, asking God to help us use the gifts He has given us to learn and take care of the world.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Dear God, thank you for giving us creative minds to learn and grow. Help us to use our skills to care for Your creation. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Sphero (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Introduce Sphero as a tool for learning about movement and control. Show students how to make Sphero move forward, turn, and stop using the app.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain that God gives us the ability to create and use tools like robots to help take care of the Earth and all its creatures.

### **3. Hands-On Activity (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will take turns guiding Sphero through a simple course of obstacles representing God’s creation (toy animals, plants). The goal is to move carefully around the objects without bumping into them.
- **Catholic Integration**: Relate the activity to stewardship, explaining how we can use technology to care for the world around us.

### **4. Reflection and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students reflect on how they used technology to complete their task. Ask them to share one way technology can help take care of God's creation.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Discuss how robots like Sphero can help us solve real-world problems, just as God calls us to use our talents to care for the world and others.
- **Teamwork**: Emphasize how working together to control Sphero mirrors the importance of community and cooperation, as God asks us to live and work in harmony with others.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation**: Observe how well students engage with Sphero and the activity.
- **Understanding**: Evaluate students’ ability to control the robot and understand the connection between the lesson and Catholic values.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer of thanks for the opportunity to learn and grow.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Thank You, God, for helping us learn new things and for giving us talents that we can use to take care of Your creation. Help us to use technology wisely and to always work together. Amen."
