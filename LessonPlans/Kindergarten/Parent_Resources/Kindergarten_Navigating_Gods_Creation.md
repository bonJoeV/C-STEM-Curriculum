### Parent Connection: Navigating God's Creation

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students explored different ways to navigate and explore God's creation, using maps, compasses, and modern technology like GPS. We discussed how navigating the world helps us appreciate the beauty and diversity of God's creation.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. How did you navigate through the lesson today? What tools did you use?
2. What is your favorite thing about exploring new places?
3. How do you think exploring the world helps us appreciate God's creation?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Go on a nature walk or a mini-adventure using a map or compass.
- Talk about how GPS technology is used today to explore places, from hiking trails to driving routes.
- Plan a family outing to a new place and talk about the importance of preparation and navigation.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Discuss how God calls us to explore and care for His creation, recognizing the beauty and complexity of the world He has made for us.
