### Parent Connection: Building and Programming with EV3 (Kindergarten)

#### What did we do today?
- Today in class, we explored basic robotics using Lego Mindstorms EV3. The students built simple structures with Duplos and programmed the EV3 robot to follow basic commands like moving in a straight line. We talked about how technology helps us solve problems and how God gives us creativity to take care of His creation.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What did you build today with the robot and Duplos?
2. How did you make the robot move?
3. What do you think robots can do to help people in real life?
4. How did you work with your classmates to program the robot?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Look for everyday machines or technology at home (like microwaves or washing machines). Ask your child how they think these machines work.
- Build a simple obstacle course at home and pretend to guide an imaginary robot through it. Discuss how robots follow commands.
- Watch a short video about robots helping people in different jobs and talk about how technology can be used to solve problems.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Talk with your child about how we can use our talents to care for God’s creation, just like how the robot helps us solve problems. Ask them how they can use what they learned to help others.

#### Further activities:
- Encourage your child to design their own robot using paper and markers. Ask them what the robot’s special abilities would be.
- If you have building toys like blocks or Legos, challenge your child to create a robot structure at home.
