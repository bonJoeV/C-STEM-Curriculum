## **How You Can Support Learning at Home**
- **Build Together**: Use blocks, books, or other household items to build structures together. Let your child explain how gravity affects the movement of objects.
- **Ask Questions**: Encourage your child to think about how different angles or materials change the way the ball moves. Ask them how they made their ball run in class.
- **Reflect on Stewardship**: Talk about how we take care of the things we use, like toys, and how that connects to caring for God’s creation.
