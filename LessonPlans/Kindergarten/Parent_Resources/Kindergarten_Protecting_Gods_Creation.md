### Parent Connection: Protecting God’s Creation

#### What did we do today?
- In today’s lesson, students learned how we are called to protect God’s creation. We focused on environmental conservation and discussed how engineering solutions, like renewable energy and recycling, can help care for the Earth.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What did you learn about protecting the environment today?
2. How do engineers help solve environmental problems?
3. What can we do as a family to help care for God's creation?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Start a small recycling project at home and discuss how it helps reduce waste.
- Watch a documentary or video about renewable energy and discuss how it protects the environment.
- Plan a family clean-up day at a local park or nature area to help care for God’s creation.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on the Catholic teaching of stewardship and how we are called to be responsible caretakers of the Earth, preserving its beauty for future generations.
