### Parent Connection: Building Bridges and Connections

#### What did we do today?
- In today's lesson, students learned about the concept of building bridgesâ€”both literally and figuratively. We explored how bridges connect communities and how engineers solve real-world problems. Students also discussed ways we can build personal connections with others through kindness and understanding.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What type of bridge did you build today, and how does it connect people or places?
2. How do you think bridges can help bring people together?
3. Can you think of ways we can build "bridges" between people in our daily lives?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Visit a local bridge and talk about its importance to the community.
- Build a bridge using materials at home (Legos, blocks, or cardboard) and test how much weight it can hold.
- Discuss ways to build strong relationships with family members, friends, or neighbors.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on the idea that Jesus calls us to build bridges with others through kindness, love, and forgiveness, fostering unity in our communities.
