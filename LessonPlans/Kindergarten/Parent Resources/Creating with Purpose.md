### Parent Connection: Creating with Purpose

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students explored the idea of creating with purpose, focusing on how God designed the world with a plan. They worked on projects where they designed and built something with specific intentions and discussed how their creations reflect God's purposeful creation.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What did you create today, and what purpose does it serve?
2. How do you think God designed the world with purpose?
3. Why is it important to think about the purpose behind what we create?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Work on a creative project together (drawing, building, or crafting), and talk about the purpose behind it.
- Discuss everyday objects around the house and how they are designed with a specific purpose.
- Encourage your child to design something new and explain what purpose it serves.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on how God created the world with intention and how we are all part of His divine plan, designed to serve a purpose in life.
