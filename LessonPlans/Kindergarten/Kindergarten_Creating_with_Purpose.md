## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for guidance in being a light to the world.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for sending Jesus, who is the light of the world. Help us to be lights in our own way and to help others. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Circuits (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show students how circuits work and explain how electricity travels through them to power things like lights and fans.
- **Connection to Faith**: Relate the concept of light to Jesus, who is the light of the world, and talk about how we can spread His light through kindness.

### **3. Hands-On Activity: Building with Little Bits (20 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Guide students through building a simple circuit using [Little Bits](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) to power a light or small fan. 
- **Catholic Integration**: Discuss how technology can be used for good, helping others, and how we can use our gifts to spread light in the world.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to draw a picture of how they can be a light in the world (e.g., helping a friend, being kind to someone, caring for the earth).
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their drawings and reflect on how they can spread the light of Christ through their actions.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Being a Light in the World**: Discuss how, just as circuits power lights, we can be a light in the world by following Jesus' teachings and helping others.
- **Using Technology for Good**: Talk about how technology can help solve problems and be used in ways that serve others and reflect Godâ€™s love.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in Building with Little Bits**: Observe how well students follow instructions and complete the circuits.
- **Reflection Drawings**: Evaluate students' understanding of how they can be lights in the world through their actions.

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer asking for help in being lights to others.
