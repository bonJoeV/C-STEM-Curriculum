# Kindergarten STEM Lesson Plan: Exploring God's Creation with Augmented Reality

## Topic:
Exploring God's Creation using Augmented Reality (AR)

## Tools:
- Chromebook/iPad
- AR App (e.g., Quiver, Merge Cube)
- Dash Robot (from the CSCOE STEM Inventory)

## Lesson Activity:
Students will use an AR app to explore various aspects of God's creation, such as animals, plants, and natural landscapes. The AR tools will allow students to interact with 3D objects and see how different elements of creation function.

### Steps:
1. Introduction to AR: Explain what augmented reality is and how we can use it to explore the world around us.
2. Using AR to explore God's creation: Use AR to display various animals or environments (e.g., jungle, ocean, forest).
3. Interaction: Allow students to interact with the displayed objects (e.g., "Touch the lion and see how it moves").
4. Discussion: How does exploring nature help us appreciate and care for God's world?
5. Activity: Use the Dash Robot to navigate through a simple AR-based map representing a natural environment.

## Catholic Integration:
Discuss the idea of stewardship—how we are responsible for taking care of God's creation. Reflect on the beauty of nature as a gift from God.

## Reflection:
How can we use technology to better understand and care for the world God has given us?

## Homework:
Look for examples of God's creation in your neighborhood (plants, animals, etc.) and talk with your family about how you can care for them.

## Catholic Quote:
“God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.” (Genesis 1:31)
