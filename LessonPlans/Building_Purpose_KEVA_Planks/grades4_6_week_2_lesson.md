# Load-Bearing Testing and Structural Improvement - Week 2

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 40 minutes  
### **Topic**: Testing Structural Integrity and Load-Bearing

---

## **Overview**
In Week 2, students in Grades 4-6 test the load-bearing capacity of their bridge designs and make adjustments to improve structural stability.

### **Objective**
- Understand the importance of structural integrity in engineering.
- Develop problem-solving skills through testing and improving bridge designs.

---

## **Materials**
- Chromebooks/iPads
- Keva Planks
- Dash Robot (optional, available in CSCOE inventory)

---

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (3 minutes)**
Start with a prayer for wisdom and patience in problem-solving.
_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Dear Lord, give us patience and wisdom as we learn to build strong and safe structures. Amen."

### **2. Review of Load-Bearing Concepts (5 minutes)**
- **Discussion**: Revisit load-bearing concepts and the importance of creating structures that support weight.
- **Connection to Faith**: Discuss our duty to create structures that serve and protect others, reflecting Godâ€™s care.

### **3. Main Activity (25 minutes)**
- **Activity**: Test each bridge structure with incremental weights or use Dash Robot to apply pressure. Students will observe where their bridges fail and identify areas for improvement.
- **Redesign**: Based on observations, students will adjust their bridges to enhance load-bearing capacity.
- **Catholic Integration**: Discuss the ethical responsibility of creating reliable structures for the common good.

### **4. Reflection & Sharing (5 minutes)**
- **Activity**: Share insights gained from testing and improving designs, emphasizing the role of perseverance.

---

## **Catholic Integration**
**Ethical Responsibility and Stewardship**  
Encourage students to reflect on how their designs can contribute to safety and service to others, embodying the values of stewardship and responsibility.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation**: Observe problem-solving approaches and engagement in redesigning.
- **Understanding**: Assess knowledge of load-bearing principles and ability to make informed structural improvements.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**
Conclude with a prayer for continued growth in knowledge and responsibility.
_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Thank You, God, for helping us grow in knowledge and care for others through our work. Amen."

# Parent Resources

Students focused on testing the load-bearing capacity of structures and improving bridge stability.

### **Discussion Points**
- Ask your child about the changes they made to strengthen their bridge.
- Discuss why building safe and strong structures is important for communities.

### **How You Can Support At Home**
- Encourage your child to test and improve simple structures using household items, reinforcing concepts of stability and strength.
