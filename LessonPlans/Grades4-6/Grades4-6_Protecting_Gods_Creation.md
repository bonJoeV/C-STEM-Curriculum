# Grades 4-6: Protecting God’s Creation with Engineering

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Environmental engineering and stewardship

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will simulate cleaning up an oil spill, exploring how engineers use technology to protect the environment. They will learn about their responsibility as stewards of God’s creation and how engineering can help fulfill this responsibility.

### **Objective**
- To introduce environmental engineering through a hands-on oil spill cleanup simulation.
- To emphasize the Catholic teaching of stewardship and the importance of caring for creation.
- To foster problem-solving and teamwork skills in addressing real-world environmental issues.

## **Materials**
- [EiE: Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- Water, sponges, and paper towels (for oil spill simulation)
- Drawing paper and pencils

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for guidance in caring for God’s creation.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for the world You have made. Help us to be good stewards of Your creation and to protect it with love and care. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Oil Spill Cleanup (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Introduce the concept of oil spills and their harmful effects on wildlife and the environment. Show images or videos of real oil spill cleanups and how engineers respond to these disasters.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain how God calls us to be good stewards of creation, caring for the earth and everything in it.

### **3. Oil Spill Cleanup Simulation (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Using the [EiE: Cleaning an Oil Spill Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/), simulate an oil spill in a container of water. Students will work in teams to clean up the spill using sponges and other materials. Discuss which methods are most effective.
- **Catholic Integration**: Reflect on how engineers solve environmental problems, and discuss how we can all contribute to caring for God’s creation through our choices and actions.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to reflect on the oil spill cleanup and how we can protect the environment in our daily lives. Have them draw or write about one action they can take to care for the earth, such as recycling, conserving water, or reducing waste.
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their reflections and discuss practical ways to be stewards of creation.

---

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship of Creation**: Emphasize that we are called to care for God’s creation, and that engineers help protect the environment through their work.
- **Practical Stewardship**: Discuss how we can all take small steps to protect the earth, and how these actions reflect our love and care for God’s creation.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Teamwork in Oil Spill Cleanup**: Observe how well students work together to clean up the oil spill and solve the environmental challenge.
- **Reflection Activity**: Assess students' understanding of stewardship and how they can apply it in their daily lives.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer of thanks for God’s creation and asking for help in caring for it.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for the beauty of Your creation. Help us to protect the earth and be good stewards of all that You have made. Amen."
