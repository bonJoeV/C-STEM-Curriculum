### Parent Connection: Innovating for Good

#### What did we do today?
- In class, students explored how innovation and technology can be used to solve problems and help others. They worked on designing simple solutions to real-world challenges, reflecting on how innovation can be used for good.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What problem did you work on solving today with your invention?
2. How do you think technology can help make the world a better place?
3. What are some other ways we can use creativity to help people?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Talk about problems at home or in the community that could be solved with a creative invention.
- Watch videos about innovative technologies that are making a positive difference in the world, such as clean energy or medical devices.
- Encourage your child to come up with new ideas to help people in their everyday life.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on how God gives us the creativity and ability to innovate for the good of others, just as Jesus helped those in need.
