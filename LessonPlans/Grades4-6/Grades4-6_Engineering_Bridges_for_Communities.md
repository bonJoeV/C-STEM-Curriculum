# Grades 4-6: Engineering Bridges for Communities

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Designing and testing bridges for strength and durability

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will design and build bridges using engineering principles. They will reflect on how engineers solve problems to serve their communities, connecting the concept of bridges to how we help and support others in need.

### **Objective**
- To introduce students to engineering design principles and problem-solving.
- To reflect on how we, as Catholics, can be bridges between people, helping others in need.
- To develop collaboration and critical thinking through hands-on engineering tasks.

## **Materials**
- [EiE: Designing Bridges Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- Chromebooks (optional for research)
- Paper and pencils for planning

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin the class with a prayer asking for help in being strong bridges of support to others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for teaching us how to support one another. Help us to build strong relationships and help those in need, just like engineers build strong bridges. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Bridge Design (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Discuss different types of bridges and how they serve communities by connecting people. Show examples of real-world bridges and explain the engineering behind their designs.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain how, just as engineers design bridges to connect places, we are called to connect with and help others, building strong relationships and supporting those in need.

### **3. Bridge Design Challenge (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will work in groups using the [EiE: Designing Bridges Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) to build and test bridges that must support weight. Emphasize the importance of teamwork and problem-solving.
- **Catholic Integration**: Reflect on how we are called to support each other, just like bridges support the weight of travelers. Discuss how helping others is a way of building a strong community.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to reflect on how they worked as a team to build their bridges. Have them draw or write about how they can be "bridges" for others in their lives by offering help or support.
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their reflections and discuss how they can act as bridges in their communities.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Building Relationships**: Emphasize that, just as bridges connect people and places, we are called to help connect people and offer support in times of need.
- **Helping Others**: Reflect on how being a bridge for others is a way of living out Jesus’ teachings to love and care for one another.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Teamwork and Bridge Design**: Observe how well students collaborate to design and test their bridges.
- **Reflection Activity**: Assess students’ understanding of how they can act as bridges in their own lives, helping others.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
Conclude the lesson with a prayer asking for help in being strong bridges to those who need support.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for giving us the opportunity to help others. Help us to be strong and supportive, like bridges, for those who need us. Amen."
