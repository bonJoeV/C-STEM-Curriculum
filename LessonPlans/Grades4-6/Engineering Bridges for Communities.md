# Grades 4-6: Week 2 - Engineering Bridges for Communities

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Designing and testing bridges for strength and durability

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will design and build bridges using engineering principles. They will reflect on how engineers solve problems to serve their communities, connecting the concept of bridges to how we help and support others in need.

### **Objective**
- To introduce students to engineering design principles and problem-solving.
- To reflect on how we, as Catholics, can be bridges between people, helping others in need.
- To develop collaboration and critical thinking through hands-on engineering tasks.

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin the class with a prayer asking for help in being strong bridges of support to others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for teaching us how to support one another. Help us to build strong relationships and help those in need, just like engineers build strong bridges. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Bridge Design (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Discuss different types of bridges and how they serve communities by connecting people. Show examples of real-world bridges and explain the engineering behind their designs.
- **Connection to Faith**:
