## Week 3: Adventure 1 - Out of This World

- **Objective:** Introduce aerospace engineering, rockets, and rovers. Students test how weight affects rocket flight using stomp rocket launchers.
- **Activity:** Students test rockets by adjusting variables like weight and launch angle. They record their data in Engineering Journals to understand the impact of these changes.
- **Catholic Connection:** Discuss marveling at God’s creation through space exploration, reflecting on Psalm 8:3-4.
- **Homework:** Research a NASA mission exploring a planet or moon and its benefits to humanity.

## Week 4: Adventure 2 - Boost Your Knowledge

- **Objective:** Explore rocket variables and test their impacts on flight.
- **Activity:** Groups test different variables (rocket length, width, material) and record data to share findings. This activity emphasizes understanding trade-offs in engineering.
- **Catholic Connection:** Emphasize the Catholic value of collaboration and the importance of sharing knowledge for the common good, inspired by St. Paul’s teachings on unity.
- **Homework:** Reflect on how trade-offs are necessary in life and engineering, linking to biblical examples.

## Week 5: Adventure 3 - Shoot for the Moon

- **Objective:** Design and build model rovers to explore chosen space destinations.
- **Activity:** Students work in teams to choose a destination and create a rover model. They consider the trade-offs of adding tools, understanding how weight affects rocket launch capabilities.
- **Catholic Connection:** Relate the trade-offs and decisions to the concept of discernment in Catholic teaching, discussing how we balance resources and needs wisely.
- **Homework:** Write a short reflection on how the EDP helps make improvements in life and engineering.
