# Grades 4-6: Navigating God’s Creation with Dash Robots

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Basic coding and navigation using Dash Robots

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will explore basic coding and navigation using Dash Robots. They will design paths for the robots to follow that mimic the role of stewards, helping others and taking care of creation.

### **Objective**
- To introduce basic coding and problem-solving skills using Dash Robots.
- To understand the Catholic call to stewardship by designing paths that reflect caring for others and creation.
- To foster creativity and teamwork through technology.

## **Materials**
- [Dash Robots](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- Chromebooks for block coding (optional)
- Drawing paper and pencils

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for guidance in being stewards of God’s creation and helping others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for giving us the ability to create and learn. Help us to use our gifts to care for others and the world around us. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Dash Robots and Coding (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Introduce Dash Robots and explain how students can code them to move through sequences of actions (forward, backward, left, right).
- **Connection to Faith**: Relate programming Dash Robots to God’s guidance in our lives, helping us make decisions that align with His will.

### **3. Dash Robots Stewardship Challenge (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will work in teams to design paths for their Dash Robots to follow, simulating tasks of stewardship, such as cleaning up a park or delivering supplies to someone in need. Students will use block coding to program the robots.
- **Catholic Integration**: Reflect on the concept of stewardship and how God calls us to care for creation and help those in need.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to draw or write about how their Dash Robot helped care for creation or helped others. Reflect on how we can be stewards in our everyday lives.
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their designs and reflections, discussing how technology can be used for good.

---

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Emphasize the Catholic call to stewardship, using technology to care for others and the environment.
- **Making Ethical Decisions**: Relate programming the Dash Robots to making ethical decisions in life, guided by faith.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in Coding**: Observe how well students work in teams to program their Dash Robots.
- **Reflection Activity**: Assess students’ understanding of stewardship and how they can apply it to technology and everyday actions.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer asking for help in being good stewards of God’s creation.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for teaching us how to care for the world and others. Help us to be good stewards in all we do. Amen."
