# Grades 4-6: Building and Programming with EV3

### **Grade**: Grades 4-6  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Advanced Robotics and Engineering

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students in Grades 4-6 will explore advanced robotics concepts using Lego Mindstorms EV3. They will learn to program the robot to solve environmental challenges, connecting their learning to Catholic values of stewardship and responsibility.

### **Objective**
- To introduce advanced robotics and engineering concepts.
- To develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- To reflect on how we can use our talents to care for God’s creation and solve real-world problems.

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer, asking God to guide our learning as we use our gifts to care for the world.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Dear God, thank You for giving us the ability to learn and create. Help us to use our knowledge to take care of Your creation and serve others. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Advanced Robotics (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Introduce advanced EV3 robot components, such as sensors (touch, ultrasonic, and color). Explain how robots can be programmed to solve real-world challenges, like environmental problems.
- **Connection to Faith**: Discuss how God gives us the ability to solve problems, just as we are called to protect and care for His creation.

### **3. Build and Program the EV3 (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will work in small groups to build a more complex EV3 robot, incorporating sensors. They will program the robot to navigate a course that represents environmental challenges, such as avoiding obstacles or responding to pollution.
- **Catholic Integration**: Relate the problem-solving activity to how we are called to use our talents responsibly, protecting the environment and serving others.

### **4. Reflection and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Have students reflect on how they worked as a team to program the robot to overcome challenges. Encourage them to share how they can use their talents to help solve real-world problems in line with their faith.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Discuss how robots can help solve environmental challenges, connecting to our call as stewards of God’s creation.
- **Responsibility and Service**: Emphasize the importance of using our gifts responsibly, for the common good, and in service to others.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation**: Monitor students' engagement during the building and programming activities.
- **Teamwork**: Evaluate how effectively students collaborate to complete the challenge.
- **Understanding**: Assess students’ understanding of robotics and its connection to Catholic teachings on stewardship and responsibility.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer of gratitude for the opportunity to learn and serve through technology.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Thank You, God, for helping us learn new ways to solve problems and care for the world. Help us to always use our talents to serve others and protect Your creation. Amen."
