### Parent Connection: Building and Programming with EV3 (Grades 4-6)

#### What did we do today?
- Today in class, we worked on advanced robotics using Lego Mindstorms EV3. Students built robots with sensors and programmed them to navigate a course, avoiding obstacles like pollution. We discussed how technology can be used to solve environmental problems and how God calls us to be responsible stewards of the Earth.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. How did you program the robot to avoid obstacles?
2. What was the hardest part of today’s activity, and how did you solve it?
3. How can robots help solve environmental problems like pollution?
4. How did you work with your classmates to complete the task?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Talk about different ways technology can help care for the environment, like solar panels or recycling machines. Ask your child how robots might help with these tasks.
- Create an obstacle course at home and use a toy or object as a "robot" to navigate through it. Ask your child how they programmed their robot in class to avoid obstacles.
- Watch a video about how technology is being used to clean oceans or reduce pollution and discuss what you learned.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Talk with your child about the importance of being good stewards of God’s creation, as we learned in class. Ask them how they can use their talents to protect the environment and serve others.

#### Further activities:
- If your child enjoys drawing, have them design a robot that could help reduce pollution or protect the environment. Ask them to describe how it works.
- If you have access to building toys, encourage your child to build a robot or machine that solves a problem, like picking up trash or helping people in need.
