# Parent Guide: Advanced Ball Run Engineering

## **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Topic**: Advanced Physics and Engineering Design

---

## **Overview**
Your child is learning advanced concepts of physics, such as gravity, momentum, and friction, through an exciting ball run engineering challenge using KEVA Planks. They are working in teams to design more complex ball runs, applying these physics principles and documenting the process on iPads. The lesson integrates faith by encouraging reflection on how God’s design is reflected in the laws of physics and how teamwork helps us solve challenges.

---

## **What We Learned**
- **Physics Concepts**: Your child learned how gravity, momentum, and friction affect motion and used these principles to design their ball run.
- **Engineering Process**: They worked through the engineering design process, testing and refining their ball runs to make them more efficient.
- **Teamwork**: The activity emphasized collaboration and how working together helps solve complex problems.

## **How You Can Support Learning at Home**
- **Build and Explore**: Encourage your child to recreate their ball run or design new structures using household items. Ask them to explain how different physics principles affect the movement of objects.
- **Discuss Teamwork**: Talk about how working with others, both at school and at home, helps us accomplish tasks and solve problems.
- **Reflect on God’s Design**: Have a conversation about how the complexity of the physical world reflects God’s design and order in creation.

## **Connection to Faith**
This lesson helped your child reflect on how the laws of physics are part of God’s creation. It also emphasized the importance of teamwork, teaching that working together reflects God’s call for us to help one another.
