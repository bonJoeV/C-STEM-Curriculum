### Parent Connection: Protecting God’s Creation with Engineering

#### What did we do today?
- Students explored how engineers create solutions to protect the environment, reflecting on their role as stewards of God’s creation. We worked on projects related to environmental conservation, discussing how technology can be used to protect our planet.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What kind of project did you work on today to help the environment?
2. How do you think engineers can help protect God’s creation?
3. What is something we can do as a family to care for the environment?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Start a small environmental project at home, such as recycling or reducing waste, and discuss its impact.
- Watch videos about environmental technology, such as wind turbines or solar panels, and discuss how they help protect God’s creation.
- Plan a family clean-up day at a local park or nature area to care for the environment.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on the Catholic teaching of stewardship and how we are called to protect and care for God’s creation.
