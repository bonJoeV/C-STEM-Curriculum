### Parent Connection: Engineering Bridges for Communities

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students learned about how bridges connect communities and how engineers design them to solve specific problems. We explored the importance of bridges in our society and built model bridges using simple materials.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What type of bridge did you build, and how did it work?
2. Why are bridges important for communities?
3. What was the hardest part about building your bridge?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Visit a local bridge and discuss how it was built and why it is important to the community.
- Build a small bridge at home with materials like cardboard, tape, or blocks, and test its strength.
- Talk about how we can "bridge gaps" between people by being kind and helping others, reflecting on Godâ€™s teachings.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Discuss the idea of being "bridges" in life, helping others connect and fostering community, as Jesus calls us to do.
