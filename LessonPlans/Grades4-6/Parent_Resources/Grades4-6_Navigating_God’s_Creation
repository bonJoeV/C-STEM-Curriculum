### Parent Connection: Navigating God’s Creation 

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students used Dash Robots to explore and navigate different spaces. We focused on programming the robots to move in specific ways, reflecting on how we navigate God’s creation and how technology can help us understand and appreciate the world around us.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. How did you program the Dash Robot today? 
2. What was the most fun or challenging part of navigating with the robot?
3. How do you think robots help us explore God's creation?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Use simple programming apps to continue exploring how robots navigate spaces.
- Talk about how robots are used in exploration, from space missions to deep-sea diving, to learn more about God’s creation.
- Plan a small "navigation course" at home and have your child explain how they would program the Dash Robot to complete the course.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on how technology can help us understand God's creation and our responsibility to care for it.
