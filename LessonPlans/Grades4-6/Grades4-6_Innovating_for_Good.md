## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will explore circuits using Little Bits. They will reflect on how innovation and technology can be used to serve the greater good, and how we can use our talents to help others, in line with Catholic teachings.

### **Objective**
- To introduce students to circuits and basic electronics through hands-on building with Little Bits.
- To foster creativity and innovation while thinking about how technology can be used ethically.
- To reflect on how we can use our gifts to help others and solve problems.

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for guidance in using our gifts to help others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for the gifts and talents You have given us. Help us to use them wisely and in service of others. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Circuits (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show students how circuits work by explaining the flow of electricity through a simple circuit. Introduce Little Bits and how they can be used to create basic electronics.
- **Connection to Faith**: Explain that, just as circuits bring light or power to a device, we are called to bring light to the world by using our talents to serve others.

### **3. Hands-On Activity: Building Circuits (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Guide students through building simple circuits using [Little Bits](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/). Allow them to create circuits that power lights or fans. Discuss how these simple inventions could be used to solve problems or help others.
- **Catholic Integration**: Reflect on how we can use technology for good, solving real-world problems and helping others in need. Discuss the ethical responsibility that comes with innovation.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to draw or write about how they can use their talents and creativity to help others. Examples might include designing devices that help the environment or creating technology that assists people in need.
- **Sharing**: Allow students to share their ideas and discuss how they can use innovation to reflect Catholic values and help those around them.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Using Gifts for Good**: Emphasize that God calls us to use our gifts and talents to serve others and solve problems in ways that reflect His love.
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Discuss how we have a responsibility to ensure that technology is used ethically and in ways that benefit society.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in Circuit Building**: Observe how well students engage with the hands-on activity and complete the circuits.
- **Reflection Activity**: Assess studentsâ€™ understanding of how they can use innovation to serve others and reflect their Catholic values.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer asking for help in using our talents to serve others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for giving us the ability to learn and create. Help us to use our talents to bring light to the world and to help those in need. Amen."
