# Grades 4-6: Advanced Ball Run Engineering

### **Grade**: 4-6  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Advanced Physics and Engineering Design

---

## **Overview**
Students will engage in the engineering design process to create complex ball runs using KEVA Planks. They will explore physics concepts such as gravity, momentum, and friction, and apply these principles to build an effective course. The lesson integrates Catholic values by focusing on how God’s design is reflected in the laws of physics and how working together mirrors His call for us to help others.

### **Objective**
- To understand the concepts of gravity, momentum, and friction.
- To design and test a complex ball run, documenting the process through iPads.
- To reflect on how the complexity of physics mirrors God’s design and how we can serve others through our skills.

## **Materials**
- KEVA Planks (from [CSCOE STEM Inventory](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/))
- iPads (to create engineering video logs)

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer reflecting on the wonder of God’s creation and the laws of physics.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for the incredible world You have made, full of order and beauty. Help us to learn and appreciate Your creation. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Physics and the Engineering Process (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Explain the engineering design process and how physics concepts like gravity, momentum, and friction affect ball runs. Give examples of how engineers solve real-world problems using these concepts.
- **Connection to Faith**: Discuss how God’s order in nature reflects His plan for us to use our skills to solve problems and help others.

### **3. Engineering Design Challenge (30 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: In small groups, students will design and build a complex ball run using KEVA Planks. They are encouraged to include jumps, curves, and obstacles that demonstrate their understanding of physics.
- **Catholic Integration**: Emphasize that just like engineers build solutions, we are called to help and support others in our lives.

### **4. Document and Reflect (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students create an engineering video log on their iPads, recording each step of the design process and explaining how physics principles were applied.
- **Reflection**: Have students reflect on how solving problems in this project relates to solving real-life challenges and serving others, just as Jesus taught us.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **God’s Design in Physics**: Reflect on how the laws of physics are part of God’s creation and how we can use our understanding of them to solve problems and help others.
- **Service and Stewardship**: Discuss how engineers serve their communities by solving problems, and how we are called to do the same through our skills and knowledge.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Engineering Video Log**: Evaluate how well students document their process and explain the physics concepts they applied.
- **Collaboration and Creativity**: Assess how students work together and approach complex challenges in their ball run designs.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer of thanks for the opportunity to learn and create together.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for teaching us about Your world and for giving us the skills to create and solve problems. Help us to always use our talents to serve others. Amen."
