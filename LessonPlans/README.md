# LessonPlans

Welcome to the **LessonPlans** folder! This repository contains detailed STEM lesson plans for **Kindergarten**, **Grades 1-3**, and **Grades 4-6**. These lessons integrate Catholic teachings with STEM education, fostering creativity, ethical decision-making, and problem-solving through hands-on technology and engineering activities.

## Overview

Each lesson plan spans a 50-minute session and focuses on **Technology** and **Engineering**, with strong connections to **Catholic values** such as stewardship, respect for creation, and ethical responsibility. 

Lesson plans are organized by grade level and week, each following a four-week structure with a specific focus for each week. Lessons utilize tools from the [CSCOE STEM Inventory](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) to engage students with hands-on learning.

## Catholic Integration

Each lesson incorporates **Catholic teachings** that align with:
- **Stewardship**: Understanding our responsibility to care for God's creation and to make ethical decisions in technology and engineering.
- **Respect for Life and Creation**: Highlighting the importance of protecting life and creation as part of our Catholic values.
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Promoting discussions about how to responsibly use technology to serve others and improve the world.

## CSCOE STEM Inventory

The lessons utilize resources available from the [CSCOE STEM Inventory](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/), including tools such as:
- **Bee Bots** for coding and navigation
- **EiE Engineering Kits** for hands-on problem-solving
- **Dash Robots** for block coding and robotics
- **Little Bits** for exploring circuits and electronics

These tools help students gain practical STEM experience while connecting their learning to Catholic ethics and values.
