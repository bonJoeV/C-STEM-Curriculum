# LessonPlans

Welcome to the **LessonPlans** folder! This repository contains detailed STEM lesson plans designed for Catholic elementary school students, specifically for **Kindergarten**, **Grades 1-3**, and **Grades 4-6**. Each lesson integrates Catholic teachings, emphasizing stewardship, ethical responsibility, and creativity through hands-on technology and engineering activities.

## Overview

Each lesson plan spans a 50-minute session and focuses on topics related to **Technology** and **Engineering**, with strong connections to **Catholic values**. Lessons are grouped by grade level and cover a wide variety of topics ranging from **coding basics** to **engineering problem-solving** and **environmental stewardship**.

The lesson plans are organized into weekly sessions, with resources drawn from the **CSCOE STEM Inventory**. These lessons are designed to encourage collaboration, critical thinking, and ethical discussions around the use of technology and engineering.

- **Ethical Responsibility**: Promoting discussions on the responsible use of technology and innovation in alignment with Catholic values.

## CSCOE STEM Inventory

The lessons utilize resources available from the [CSCOE STEM Inventory](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/), which includes tools such as:
- **Bee Bots** for coding and navigation
- **EiE Engineering Kits** for problem-solving
- **Dash Robots** for block coding
- **Little Bits** for exploring circuits and technology

These tools help students gain practical experience with STEM while connecting their learning to Catholic faith and ethics.
