# **Pi Day Celebration: God’s Design in Circles**  
## **Lesson Overview**
- **Topic:** Discovering Pi (π) and the Beauty of Circles  
- **Tools:** iPad, Chromebook, Scratch Jr, Tinkercad, Measuring Tape, Paper Plates  
- **Catholic Connection:** Circles as a reflection of God’s eternal love and intelligent design  
- **Lesson Duration:** 50 minutes  

---

## **Lesson Activities**
### **Kindergarten: "Circles in God’s Creation"**
📖 **Concept:** Finding circles in nature and understanding their significance.  

#### **Step 1: Circle Hunt**
- **Objective:** Identify and appreciate circular patterns in God’s creation.  
- **Activity:**
  - Show images of **the sun, flowers, fruits, rings, and ripples in water**.
  - Walk around the classroom to **find circular objects**.
  - Discuss: _"Why do you think God created so many circles?"_  

#### **Step 2: Digital Circle Art**
- **Objective:** Use an iPad to trace and color circles.  
- **Activity:**
  - Open a **drawing app (Tayasui Sketches, Jamboard)**.
  - Students will **trace circular objects** and color them in.  

📖 **Catholic Teaching Connection:**  
> "Just like a circle has no end, God’s love for us is endless."

### **Grades 1-3: "Pi Day Pattern Art"**  
📖 **Concept:** Exploring the relationship between diameter and circumference through hands-on activities.  

#### **Step 1: Measuring Pi with Paper Plates**
- **Objective:** Introduce the concept of Pi (π) as the ratio of circumference to diameter.  
- **Activity:**
  - Give students a **paper plate** and a piece of string.  
  - Have them **measure the circumference** by wrapping the string around it.  
  - Compare the length to the **diameter** using a ruler.  
  - Discuss: _"How many times does the diameter fit into the circumference?"_ (Approx. 3.14 times).  

#### **Step 2: Coding Circle Patterns**
- **Objective:** Use block coding in Scratch Jr to create repeating circular patterns.  
- **Activity:**
  - Open **Scratch Jr** on an iPad/Chromebook.  
  - Students will **program a sprite to draw a repeating circular shape**.  

📖 **Catholic Teaching Connection:**  
> "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims His handiwork." (Psalm 19:1)

### **Grades 4-6: "Pi & Engineering – The Perfect Circle"**  
📖 **Concept:** Understanding why circles are essential in engineering and technology.  

#### **Step 1: Real-World Pi Measurement**
- **Objective:** Measure circular objects and calculate Pi (π).  
- **Activity:**
  - Students will find objects (wheels, plates, cans).  
  - Using measuring tape, they will record:
    - **Circumference**
    - **Diameter**
  - Divide **circumference by diameter** and compare results to Pi.  

#### **Step 2: Engineering Circular Designs in Tinkercad**
- **Objective:** Use Tinkercad to design a circular object (e.g., a wheel or a gear).  
- **Activity:**
  - Open **Tinkercad** on Chromebook.  
  - Students will **design a 3D model of a gear or wheel** and reflect on its purpose.  
  - Discussion: _"Why do engineers use circles in transportation and machines?"_  

📖 **Catholic Teaching Connection:**  
> “How does understanding the precision of God’s design help us become better stewards of the world?”

## **Assessment**
✅ **Checklist**  
- [ ] Kindergarten: Identified circular objects and created digital circle art.  
- [ ] Grades 1-3: Measured and explored Pi using paper plates.  
- [ ] Grades 4-6: Measured real-world circles and designed a 3D circular object.

## **Catholic Integration and Reflection**
🎯 **Discussion Questions:**  
1. Why do you think God used circles in nature?  
2. How can understanding patterns like Pi help us be good stewards of the Earth?  
3. How does learning about engineering and math help us serve others?  

📖 **Bible Verse Connection:**  
> "Great is our Lord and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit." (Psalm 147:5)

## **Parent Resources**
📌 **At-Home Discussion:**  
- Look for circular objects in nature together. Discuss how they show God’s design.  
- Try measuring household objects and calculating Pi (wheels, lids, clocks).  

🎨 **Activity Suggestion:**  
- **Bake a "Pi Day" Pie** together and discuss how circles and math come together in cooking.  

---

## **Conclusion**
Through this **Pi Day Celebration**, students will develop a deeper appreciation for **God’s intelligent design in circles**, while engaging in **engineering, coding, and real-world math**.  

✝️ **Faith + STEM = Understanding God’s World!**
