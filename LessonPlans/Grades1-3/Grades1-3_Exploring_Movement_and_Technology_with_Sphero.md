# Grades 1-3: Programming with Sphero

### **Grade**: Grades 1-3  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Introduction to Basic Programming with Sphero

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students in Grades 1-3 will learn basic programming using Sphero. They will use block coding to control the robot and explore how technology can solve real-world problems.

### **Objective**
- To introduce block coding and its application in controlling robots.
- To develop problem-solving skills through programming.
- To reflect on how we can use technology for the greater good in alignment with Catholic values.

---

## **Materials**
- Sphero robots
- iPads or Chromebooks with the Sphero Edu app installed
- [Presentation](./Presentations/Grades1_3_Building_Programming_EV3.pptx)

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer, asking God to guide us as we learn how to use technology to serve Him and others.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Lord, help us use our skills to create and build tools that can help others and take care of Your creation. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Programming (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Explain how Sphero robots can be programmed to move. Introduce the concept of block coding and demonstrate how to use the Sphero app to control the robot.
- **Connection to Faith**: Talk about how God gives us the intelligence and creativity to solve problems through technology.

### **3. Programming Challenge (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will use block coding to navigate Sphero through a simulated obstacle course. The course will represent an environmental cleanup mission, such as moving around obstacles representing litter or fragile plants.
- **Catholic Integration**: Discuss how we are called to be stewards of the Earth, and how we can use technology to help solve environmental challenges.

### **4. Reflection and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to reflect on the activity. How can robots help care for the Earth and other people? Encourage them to think of other ways technology can be used for good.

---

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Emphasize the importance of using our skills to care for the Earth. Discuss how technology, like robots, can solve problems and make the world a better place.
- **Ethics**: Teach students that we must always use technology responsibly, keeping in mind the needs of others and the environment.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation**: Observe how well students engage with the programming activity and work with their classmates.
- **Understanding**: Evaluate studentsâ€™ ability to use block coding and understand the connection to Catholic values.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer of thanks for the opportunity to learn and for the gifts we can use to help others.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Thank You, Lord, for giving us minds to learn and create. Help us to use technology to care for Your world and to always think of others in all that we do. Amen."
