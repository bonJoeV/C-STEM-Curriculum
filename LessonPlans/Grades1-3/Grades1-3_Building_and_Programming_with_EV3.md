# Grades 1-3: Building and Programming with EV3

### **Grade**: Grades 1-3  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Robotics Fundamentals and Programming

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students in Grades 1-3 will explore basic robotics concepts using Lego Mindstorms EV3. They will learn how to build and program a simple robot to perform tasks, connecting their learning to Catholic values of stewardship and teamwork.

### **Objective**
- To introduce basic robotics and programming concepts.
- To develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
- To reflect on how we can use our skills to care for God's creation and serve others.

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer, asking God to guide us as we use our skills to learn and create.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Dear God, thank You for helping us learn new skills. Help us to use what we learn today to care for others and Your creation. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Robotics (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Explain the basic components of the EV3 robot (motors, sensors, etc.). Show how robots can be programmed to perform tasks, similar to how we follow God's guidance in our lives.
- **Connection to Faith**: Relate the robot's ability to follow commands to how we follow God's direction, using our gifts to serve others.

### **3. Build and Program the EV3 (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students will work in small groups to build a simple EV3 robot. They will learn to program the robot to move in a straight line and turn using basic commands.
- **Catholic Integration**: Discuss how the robot’s ability to follow commands reflects our role as stewards of God’s creation, using technology for good and serving others.

### **4. Reflection and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to reflect on how they worked together to program the robot. Encourage them to share one thing they learned and how it connects to using their gifts to help others.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Stewardship**: Discuss how technology can be used to help solve problems and care for God's creation.
- **Teamwork and Service**: Emphasize how working together to build and program the robot teaches us about supporting each other, just as God calls us to help others in our communities.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation**: Observe students' engagement in the building and programming activities.
- **Teamwork**: Evaluate how well students work together to complete the tasks.
- **Understanding**: Assess students’ grasp of basic robotics concepts and their connection to Catholic values of stewardship and service.

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer, thanking God for the opportunity to learn and for giving us gifts to serve others.

_Suggested Prayer_:  
> "Thank You, God, for helping us learn new skills today. Help us use our knowledge to take care of Your creation and serve others. Amen."
