## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will explore how circuits work using Little Bits. They will learn how technology can be used to solve problems and how we can reflect God's light in the world by using our creativity to help others.

### **Objective**
- To introduce simple circuits and electricity through hands-on building with Little Bits.
- To foster creativity and problem-solving while working with technology.
- To reflect on how we can use our gifts to spread Godâ€™s light in the world.

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for help in being a light to the world.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for sending Jesus to be the light of the world. Help us to be lights in our own way, sharing kindness and love with others. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Circuits (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show students how circuits work by explaining how electricity flows through them to power things like lights and fans.
- **Connection to Faith**: Relate the concept of light to Jesus, who is the light of the world. Discuss how we can spread His light by helping others and doing good.

### **3. Hands-On Activity: Building Circuits (20 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Guide students through building simple circuits using [Little Bits](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/). Allow them to create a circuit that lights up or powers a fan.
- **Catholic Integration**: Discuss how we can use technology to solve problems and help others, just as we are called to spread the light of Christ in our lives.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to draw a picture of how they can be a light in the world, showing kindness and care for others. Examples could include helping a friend or sharing with someone in need.
- **Sharing**: Have students share their drawings with the class, discussing how they can spread the light of Christ through their actions.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Being a Light to Others**: Emphasize that, just as circuits power lights, we can be a light to the world by helping and caring for others.
- **Technology for Good**: Talk about how we can use technology for good, to help solve problems and make the world a better place.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in Circuit Building**: Observe how well students follow instructions and complete the circuits.
- **Reflection Drawings**: Assess students' understanding of how they can be lights in the world through their actions.

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer asking for help in being lights to others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for the light of Jesus. Help us to be lights to others by being kind, helpful, and loving. Amen."
