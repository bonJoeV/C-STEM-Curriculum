### Parent Connection: Caring for Creation with Technology

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students explored how we can use technology to care for God's creation. We discussed environmental challenges and how engineers and scientists use technology to develop solutions. The students also brainstormed ideas for how they can contribute to caring for the Earth in their everyday lives.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What did you learn about how technology can help care for the environment?
2. Can you think of ways to reduce waste or conserve energy at home?
3. How do you think God wants us to take care of the Earth?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Take a nature walk and discuss how you can help protect the environment in your local community.
- Recycle together as a family and talk about how recycling helps reduce pollution.
- Research online about new technologies being developed to reduce climate change or clean the oceans.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Discuss the Catholic teaching of "stewardship" and how God calls us to care for His creation.
