### Parent Connection: Building Bridges Like Engineers

#### What did we do today?
- Today in class, we learned about the importance of bridges and how they connect communities. The students worked in teams to design and build their own model bridges using simple materials like paper, tape, and small blocks. We discussed how engineers use technology and creativity to solve problems, just like how God gave us intelligence and imagination to help others.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What materials did you use to build your bridge, and why did you choose them?
2. What was the hardest part about building your bridge?
3. How do you think bridges help people in real life?
4. How did you and your classmates work together as a team? Was it difficult or easy?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Take a walk or drive around the neighborhood and point out bridges you see. Ask your child to explain how they think the bridges work and why they are important.
- Build a simple bridge at home using items like cardboard or Popsicle sticks. Ask your child how you could make it stronger or more stable.
- Watch a short video or read a book about famous bridges, such as the Golden Gate Bridge or Tower Bridge. Discuss how these structures serve as both engineering marvels and symbols of connection between people.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Talk with your child about the concept of "bridging gaps" between people in a spiritual sense. Ask how we can be like bridges by helping others, showing love, and being kind, just as Jesus taught us.

#### Further activities:
- If you have access to toys like Legos or building blocks, encourage your child to recreate a famous bridge. Challenge them to make it as long or as tall as possible while keeping it sturdy.
- If your child enjoys drawing, have them design their dream bridge on paper and describe what makes it special.
