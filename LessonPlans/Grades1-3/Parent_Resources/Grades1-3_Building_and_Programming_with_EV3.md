### Parent Connection: Building and Programming with EV3 (Grades 1-3)

#### What did we do today?
- Today in class, we learned the basics of robotics using Lego Mindstorms EV3. The students worked in teams to build robots and program them to perform simple tasks like moving forward and turning. We discussed how technology can solve problems and how God calls us to use our talents to help others.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. How did you program the robot to move today?
2. What was the most fun or challenging part of building the robot?
3. How can robots help people solve problems in the world?
4. How did you work with your team to complete the tasks?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Explore how different machines in your home work, like a vacuum cleaner or a fan. Ask your child how they think these machines solve problems.
- Build a small robot together using craft materials like cardboard, paper rolls, or markers. Ask your child to describe what the robotâ€™s job would be.
- Watch a video or read a book about how robots are used in factories or healthcare to help people.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Talk with your child about how we can use our talents and resources to serve others, just as we learned to program robots to solve tasks. Discuss how helping others is part of our Catholic faith.

#### Further activities:
- Encourage your child to draw or design their own robot on paper. What tasks would this robot do to help people?
- If you have access to Legos or building blocks, challenge your child to build a robot at home and describe what it can do.
