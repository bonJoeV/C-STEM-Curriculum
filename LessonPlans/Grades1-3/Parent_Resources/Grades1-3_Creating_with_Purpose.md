### Parent Connection: Creating with Purpose

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students explored how to create things with intention and purpose, reflecting on how God created the world with a specific plan in mind. We worked on a project where students designed and built something using a specific set of materials and had to explain its purpose and function.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. What did you build today, and what was its purpose?
2. Why is it important to create things with a plan or purpose in mind?
3. How do you think God's creation is full of purpose?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Work on a simple project at home, such as building a structure with Legos or blocks. Talk about why each piece is important.
- Discuss examples of things that are well-designed for their purpose, such as a chair or a car.
- Encourage your child to draw or design something new and explain its function.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on how God created the world with purpose and how each person has a unique role in His plan.
