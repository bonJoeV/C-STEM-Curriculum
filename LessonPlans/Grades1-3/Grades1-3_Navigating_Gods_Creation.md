# Grades 1-3: Navigating God’s Creation

### **Grade**: 1-3  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Basic coding and navigation using Bee Bots

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will explore basic coding and directional commands using Bee Bots. The activity will emphasize patterns, decision-making, and how we can rely on God to guide us in life.

### **Objective**
- To introduce basic coding and programming concepts using Bee Bots.
- To understand how patterns and decision-making help guide paths, similar to how God guides us.
- To foster creativity and teamwork while solving navigation problems.

## **Materials**
- [Navigating God’s Creation Presentation](../LessonPlans/Grades1-3/Presentations/Grades1-3_Navigating_Gods_Creation.pptx)
- [Bee Bots](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- iPads (optional for additional Bee Bot activities)
- Large nature-themed maze mat
- Drawing paper and crayons

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Start the class with a prayer, asking God for wisdom and guidance as the students learn about making decisions and following paths.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for guiding us in life. Help us to make good choices and to follow Your path, just like we guide our Bee Bots today. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Bee Bots and Coding (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Explain to students how Bee Bots are programmed with directional commands (forward, backward, left, right). Demonstrate a simple sequence.
- **Connection to Faith**: Talk about how God also provides directions and guidance in our lives, helping us make choices.

### **3. Programming Bee Bots through the Maze (20 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Set up a large nature-themed maze mat. Students will work in pairs to program the Bee Bots to navigate the maze, helping them reach various "destinations" (trees, flowers, animals).
- **Catholic Integration**: As students guide the Bee Bots, relate the activity to how God guides us through life and helps us follow His path.

### **4. Reflection and Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Ask students to reflect on how they guided the Bee Bot through the maze. Have them draw a picture representing something they learned from the activity or a Bible story where God gave guidance (e.g., Moses leading the Israelites).
- **Sharing**: Allow time for students to share their reflections and discuss how we follow God’s guidance in our daily lives.

---

## **Catholic Integration**
- **God’s Guidance**: Emphasize how God gives us guidance just as we guide the Bee Bots. Relate this to making decisions that align with God’s teachings.
- **Making Good Choices**: Discuss how, just as we make decisions for the Bee Bots, we make choices in life that should reflect love and kindness toward others.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Participation in Programming**: Observe how well students work in pairs to program the Bee Bots and navigate the maze.
- **Reflection Drawings**: Assess the students' understanding of the connection between the activity and God’s guidance.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
Conclude with a prayer of thanks for God’s guidance in helping us make decisions.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for helping us make good choices. Help us to always follow Your path and to guide others in kindness. Amen."
