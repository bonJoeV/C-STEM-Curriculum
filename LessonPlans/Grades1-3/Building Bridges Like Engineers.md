# Grades 1-3: Building Bridges Like Engineers

### **Grade**: 1-3  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Designing and testing bridge structures

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will work together to design and test simple bridges using different materials. They will explore how engineers solve problems, relating it to how God helps us overcome obstacles and connect with others.

### **Objective**
- To introduce basic engineering concepts by designing bridges.
- To develop problem-solving and teamwork skills through collaborative building.
- To reflect on how we can be like bridges, connecting with others and helping those in need.

---

## **Materials**
- [EiE: Designing Bridges Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) (from CSCOE STEM Inventory)
- iPads (for research on bridge designs, optional)
- Paper and pencils for planning
- Lego Kit #1 (available in the classroom)

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer asking for help in building connections with others, just like we build bridges.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, help us to build strong relationships with those around us, just like the bridges we build today. Guide us as we learn how to be good friends and good problem solvers. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Bridge Building (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Show students different types of bridges (beam, arch, suspension) and explain how engineers design them to be strong and safe.
- **Connection to Faith**: Relate the concept of bridges to how God helps us connect with others, emphasizing that we are called to help those in need and build strong relationships.

### **3. Bridge Design Challenge (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Working in teams, students will use materials from the [EiE: Designing Bridges Kit](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/) to design and build a simple bridge. Test the bridges by placing small objects on them to see which can hold the most weight.
- **Catholic Integration**: Relate building bridges to being "bridges" between people, helping to solve problems and support others in times of need.

### **4. Reflection & Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Have students draw or write about how they worked together to build the bridge and how they can be a "bridge" in their community (e.g., by helping a friend or being kind).
- **Sharing**: Allow time for students to share their reflections with the class, focusing on teamwork and connection.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Building Strong Connections**: Discuss how bridges help people cross difficult terrain, and relate this to how we can help others when they are facing challenges.
- **Reflecting on Jesus**: Jesus is the ultimate bridge, connecting us to God. Emphasize how our actions should reflect this connection by helping and serving others.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Teamwork and Participation**: Observe how well students work in teams to design and test their bridges.
- **Reflection Activity**: Assess studentsâ€™ ability to reflect on the lesson and its connection to helping others.

---

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End the lesson with a prayer of thanks for the relationships we build and the help we give others.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for helping us build strong friendships and for teaching us how to work together. Help us be kind and supportive, just like bridges that support us. Amen."
