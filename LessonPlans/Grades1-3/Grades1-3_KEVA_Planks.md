# Grades 1-3: Engineering a Ball Run

### **Grade**: 1-3  
### **Duration**: 50 minutes  
### **Topic**: Introduction to Gravity, Friction, and Motion

---

## **Overview**
In this lesson, students will explore how gravity and friction affect the movement of objects. They will design and build ball runs using KEVA Planks, working together to create a structure that controls the speed and movement of a ball. Students will reflect on the role of teamwork and stewardship in their project, connecting it to how God helps us work together.

### **Objective**
- To understand how gravity and friction affect motion.
- To design a functional ball run that can control speed and movement.
- To reflect on how teamwork helps us build stronger structures and relationships, inspired by God’s love.

---

## **Materials**
- KEVA Planks (from [CSCOE STEM Inventory](https://cscoe.myturn.com/library/))
- iPads (to record videos of the designs)

---

## **Lesson Steps**

### **1. Opening Prayer (5 minutes)**  
Begin with a prayer to reflect on the importance of teamwork and collaboration.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Dear God, thank You for giving us the ability to work together and build. Help us to use our skills to create and help one another. Amen."

### **2. Introduction to Gravity and Friction (10 minutes)**  
- **Discussion**: Talk about gravity and friction, and how they affect the movement of objects. Show examples of how changing the angle of a plank can make the ball go faster or slower.
- **Connection to Faith**: Just like gravity pulls things down, God’s love supports and guides us as we help one another.

### **3. Ball Run Design Challenge (25 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Students work in groups to design and build a ball run course using KEVA Planks. Their goal is to control the speed of the ball by changing the angles and adding friction points.
- **Catholic Integration**: Discuss how teamwork makes the process smoother, just like how working together in our faith community helps us solve problems and care for one another.

### **4. Document and Reflect (5 minutes)**  
- **Activity**: Using iPads, students record videos of their ball run designs, explaining how gravity and friction affected their build.
- **Reflection**: Discuss how working as a team helped the design and how we can apply these lessons to helping others in everyday life.

## **Catholic Integration**
- **Teamwork and Support**: Emphasize how working together reflects God’s plan for us to help and support one another, just like how a team builds a successful ball run.
- **Stewardship**: Reflect on the responsibility of taking care of the materials used in the project as part of God’s creation.

---

## **Assessment**
- **Teamwork and Problem-Solving**: Observe how students collaborate and solve the challenges of building their ball runs.
- **Understanding of Concepts**: Assess students’ ability to explain how gravity and friction affected their designs.

## **Closing Prayer (2 minutes)**  
End with a prayer of gratitude for the opportunity to learn together.

_Suggested Prayer_:
> "Thank You, God, for helping us work together and learn about Your amazing creation. Help us to always use our skills to help others. Amen."
