### Parent Connection: Navigating God’s Creation

#### What did we do today?
- Today, students learned about different ways to navigate God's creation, using maps, compasses, and even modern GPS technology. We discussed how humans have always explored the world and how this exploration helps us appreciate the beauty and diversity of God's creation.

#### Questions to ask your child:
1. How did you use a map or compass today? 
2. What is your favorite thing about exploring new places?
3. How do you think exploring God’s creation helps us better understand and appreciate it?

#### Ideas to explore at home:
- Go on a mini-adventure in your neighborhood or park using a map or compass. Let your child lead the way.
- Use a simple GPS app to explore nearby places and landmarks.
- Plan a family trip to a new location and talk about the importance of preparation and navigation.

#### Catholic Integration:
- Reflect on how God calls us to explore and care for His creation, as well as how navigation and discovery are part of His gift to humanity.
