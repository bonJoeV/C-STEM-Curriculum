## Objective
Build a Snap Circuits OR gate circuit to light two LEDs, revealing a hidden QR code under paper.

## Instructions
- Use the Snap Circuits Extreme SC-750R kit.
- Build the OR gate circuit:
  - Components: 3V Battery, Switch (S1), Switch (S2), OR Gate (U2), LED Red (D1), LED Green (D2), Resistor 100Ω (R1, R2).
  - Connections: Battery (+) to S1/S2, S1 to OR Gate Input 1, S2 to Input 2, Output to R1/R2, R1 to D1 (+), R2 to D2 (+), D1(-)/D2(-) to Battery (-).
- Light both LEDs with either or both switches.
- Look under the paper for the QR code (use a flashlight if needed).
- Scan with Google Lens.

## Circuit Diagram
```
Battery (+) --- S1 --- OR Gate Input 1
Battery (+) --- S2 --- OR Gate Input 2
OR Gate Output --- R1 --- D1 (+)
OR Gate Output --- R2 --- D2 (+)
D1 (-), D2 (-) --- Battery (-)
```

## Catholic Connection
The OR gate’s inclusivity mirrors St. Francis’ love for all of God’s creation.

## Hint
Ensure the OR gate (U2) connects to both LEDs. Check switch connections.
