  - Cross top: Two boxes (10x5x5 mm), rotated 90° apart on top.
  - Blade: Box (40x10x5 mm), aligned with cylinder base.
  - Notches: Three triangular holes (5x5x5 mm), at 8, 16, 24 mm along blade.
- Group all parts into one object.
- Show the teacher your design to receive the QR code.

## Reference Image Details
