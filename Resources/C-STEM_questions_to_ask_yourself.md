## Questions to Help Find a Science Fair Project

### 1. **Interest-Based Questions**
- What are some things you enjoy doing or learning about outside of school?
- Do you like building things, exploring nature, or solving problems with technology?
- Are there any cool inventions or gadgets that fascinate you? What do you like about them?

### 2. **Real-World Connection Questions**
- Have you noticed any problems in your community or environment that you’d like to help solve?
- Do you wonder how things work, like how planes fly, how plants grow, or how robots move?
- Can you think of a way science or technology can make the world a better place?

### 3. **Catholic Values-Based Questions**
- How do you think science and engineering can help take care of God’s creation?
- Is there a way you can use technology to serve others or show love for your neighbor?
- Have you ever thought about how we can use energy or resources more responsibly?

### 4. **Hands-On or Digital Activity Preferences**
- Do you like doing hands-on projects where you get to build things, or do you prefer working on a computer or tablet?

- Is there a subject in science that you’ve already learned about in school and want to explore more deeply?

### 7. **Technology and Engineering Specific Questions**
- Do you enjoy playing with or creating things using LEGO, K’nex, or even cardboard? How about turning that into a project about engineering?
