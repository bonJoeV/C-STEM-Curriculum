# Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair

**Note:** The OLP Science Fair will be held prior to the CSCOE-sponsored Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair. The date for the OLP Science Fair is **TBD**. Students in **Grades 3-6** are encouraged to participate and showcase their projects. This will be an excellent opportunity to prepare for the larger archdiocesan event.

## Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair

Welcome to the **Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair**, an exciting event designed to showcase the creativity, problem-solving, and scientific inquiry of Catholic students in Grades 3-8. This annual fair brings together schools from across the Archdiocese to celebrate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) projects inspired by Catholic values.

## What is the Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair?

The Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair encourages students to explore the intersection of faith and science. The projects submitted to the fair reflect the values of stewardship, innovation, and ethical responsibility that align with Catholic teachings. Students work on a variety of topics, from environmental science to engineering, while integrating their knowledge of faith and their responsibilities as stewards of God’s creation.

### Who Can Participate?

Students in Grades 3-8 from Catholic schools in the Archdiocese are eligible to participate. The event is divided into two grade categories:
- Grades 3-5
- Grades 6-8

Each category will have separate awards for excellence in scientific inquiry, creativity, and the integration of Catholic values.

## How the Fair Works

The fair takes place every year, usually in the spring. Participants prepare and present projects that fall within one of the major STEM disciplines:
- **Science**: Investigating natural phenomena or conducting experiments
- **Technology**: Exploring computer science, coding, or technological advancements
- **Engineering**: Designing structures, machines, or innovative solutions to problems
- **Math**: Applying mathematical concepts to solve real-world challenges

### Judging Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on several key criteria:
- **Creativity and Innovation**: How unique is the project? Does it present a novel idea or approach?
- **Scientific Process**: Does the project demonstrate proper use of the scientific method or engineering design process?
- **Faith Integration**: Does the project reflect Catholic teachings and values such as stewardship, respect for life, and ethical responsibility?
- **Presentation**: Is the project well-organized and clearly presented? Can the student explain their project and answer questions confidently?

## Faith and Science: A Catholic Perspective

At the Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair, students are encouraged to see how their Catholic faith complements scientific discovery. From understanding the beauty and order of God’s creation to developing solutions for the common good, this event highlights how science and faith work together in harmony. We believe that STEM disciplines provide powerful tools to care for God's creation and improve the world around us.

### Sample Project Ideas

- **Engineering Projects**: Building a solar-powered device, constructing a bridge using limited materials, or designing an environmentally friendly home
- **Environmental Science**: Investigating the impact of pollution on local ecosystems or developing a water filtration system
- **Technology Projects**: Coding a game that teaches a Catholic value or building a robot to assist in everyday tasks
- **Mathematics**: Creating a model to solve real-world problems, such as resource management or population growth

## Questions to Ask Yourself

If you're unsure about where to start or how to choose a project, check out our [C-STEM Questions to Ask Yourself](./C-STEM_questions_to_ask_yourself.md) guide. This resource can help you find a project that excites and inspires you by exploring your interests, values, and curiosities.

## How to Get Involved

Schools can register their students for the Big Bang Catholic STEM Fair through the event’s online registration form. Teachers and parents are encouraged to help guide students as they choose their project topics and work through the research and development phases.

The event also includes a **Catholic STEM Mass**, where students, families, and educators gather to celebrate their work and reflect on the ways in which faith and science can contribute to the betterment of society.

We look forward to seeing the amazing projects our students will bring to the fair! Stay tuned for further details and announcements.
