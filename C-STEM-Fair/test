START: Get everything ready

Turn on the helmet sensor (it measures movement).
Set up a buzzer (if we have one) to beep when we detect a tap.
Make sure the sensor is working properly by "calibrating" it (this just means figuring out where the middle is for each direction).
LOOP: Keep checking for taps

Check movement:
Ask the sensor: "What’s the movement right now?" (X, Y, and Z directions).
Filter the data:
Clean up the movement data to ignore small stuff (we’re only looking for big hits!).
Look for a tap:
If the movement is bigger than our "tap threshold," it’s a tap!
Write down when the tap happened and how big it was.
If we have a buzzer, make it beep.
Show data on the screen:
Update the graph to show the latest movements.
Also, show the "Top 5 Biggest Hits" on the side.
STOP: Clean up

If we press Ctrl+C to stop, say "Goodbye."
Clean up the buzzer stuff (if we’re using it).
Show the "Top 10 Hits" from the whole session.


How It Works (Kid-Friendly Example)
Imagine you’re playing tag and wearing a special helmet:

The helmet has a "magic sensor" that feels every bump or tap.
It ignores tiny wiggles, but it keeps track of hard taps.
A computer shows a graph of how big the taps are.
If someone taps you really hard, it writes down the time and how big the tap was.
You can keep playing, and it will keep watching for taps until you say, "Stop." At the end, it tells you the biggest hits during the game
